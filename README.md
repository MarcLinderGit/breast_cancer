# Breast Cancer Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors

### Project Brief

**Objective:** In this project, I'll employ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify breast cancer cases. I'll classify breast cancer cases using KNN, optimize model parameters, perform dimensionality reduction with PCA, and visualize clusters in a 2D space.

Data source: Breast cancer data from sklearn.datasets

### Tasks Overview

Here's a breakdown of the tasks I'll be performing using Python:

1. **Data Load & Inspection**: I'll load and inspect the breast cancer dataset, exploring feature names and creating a label table.

2. **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification**: I'll train a KNN classifier with different k values, identify the optimal k, and visualize accuracy vs. k.

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: I'll reduce dimensionality using PCA, determining the optimal components through cumulative explained variance and cross-validation.

4. **KNN Clustering Visualization**: I'll create a 2D visualization combined with a confidence map using PCA and KNN clustering, highlighting cluster labels.
